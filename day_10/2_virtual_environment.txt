# You may have different projects with different packages in your system.
# Your one project may require pandas version 2.1 while other project may require pandas version 2.2
# If you want to do both the projects in your global system then problem may arise.
# To do one project you need to install one package and for other project the other package
# Now to solve this problem we can use virtual environment


Commands for Virtual Environment
1. python -m venv venv
    => It creates a new virtual environment with name "venv"

2. venv\Scripts\activate (for Windows device enter this command on command prompt)
   source venv/bin/activate (for mac and linux devices enter this command on terminal)
   => It activates the virtual environment

3. deactivate
    => It deactivates the environment
4. pip freeze
    => It lists all the installed packages in the environment

# If we install a package with virtual environment activated, then the package is accessible for that
# environment only. It is not installed globally. Virtual environment is only for the pip packages
