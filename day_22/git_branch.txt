# Pull Request
1. Normally, we should not merge our code from different branches to the main branch directly / locally
2. If we want to merge our changes to the main branch then it should be done through PR (Pull Request).
3. After your PR get merged by your reviewer then you should pull the code to local by using:
    "git pull" or "git pull origin <branch_name>"

# Merge Conflict
1. If there are changes in the code of the same file in two different branches and if these two branches
are merged then the merge conflict arises.
2. Merge conflicts should be fixed and committed from the discussion with your teammate.
