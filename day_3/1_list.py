# Lists are the mutable datatypes in python
# They are the sequential datatypes i.e. they are iterables
# Lists are created by enclosing elements in big brackets separated by comma

# Creating an empty list
data = []
print(data)  # []
data = list()  # using list() built-in function
print(data)  # []

# List may not contains homogenous data. Elements may vary in datatype
data = [1, 2.2, "hello", [1, 2]]
