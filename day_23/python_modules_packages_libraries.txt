1. Each python file inside a folder is a python module.
2. A folder containing all the python modules is a python package.
Python package sometimes has an __init__.py file
3. Collection of all the python packages is called a python library
4. Module name follows the rules of identifier naming.


# We can create our own local python library or can import libraries externally.
# To import external libraries we should first install in our local venv. That is done using:
    pip install <library_name>
    This command installs the python library from "PyPI". PyPI is the cloud storage for most of the
    python libraries. We can also upload our own libraries and make it available globally

=> from <module> import <function_or_class>
=> from <package> import <module>
=> from <package.module> import <function_or_class>
