# A same project in production can have multiple versions. These versions are maintained using a version
control system
# If there was no version control, then code sharing would have been difficult. It could be done either
sharing from google-drive or pen-drive which is not efficient.
# So we need version control system for two major reasons:
    1. For code collaboration
    2. For version maintenance

# There are several version control systems like git, mercurial, etc. Git is among the most famous ones


# The code written in your local system should be kept somewhere in the cloud for the safety purpose.
# We can again keep our code to google-drive or some other cloud storage. But, they do not understand
  VCS (Version Control System).
# So, we keep our code in such cloud platforms which understand VCS. For example: Github, Gitlab,
Bitbucket etc.

# In this session we use git and github.
